How does one improve his skills?

I realized that my programming skills have to be trained in order to progress my career. On the other hand, I started to do some bouldering and I see how regular training, even doing the same route several times, increases my abilities. Learning while working is sometimes not possible, because most of the times things have to be just done. Learning requires disecting the problem, failing, reflection, feedback, rephasing and writing down insights.

For some time I was thinking about how to setup such a 'programming gym' for myself, so I could train programming daily. I know that I could go to some place where people are learning in a group, but I think I would prefer to have a setup which I can use anywhere, whether alone or with a group. Best alone, because I could do it daily, mornings or late a night, at my own pace and about a topic of my choice. Advantage is that I would learn things which I need to improve and disadvantage is that I would need to figure out on what to focus by myself.

My goal is to train programming everyday. With bouldering I started to go once a week. Then at some point of time I realized that it's not enough for me and started to go on to the climbing wall twice, sometimes three times a week. I keep Tuesday as the mandatory day for climbing, every other day is additional. With learning programmning, I could do the same. One day in a week, best always the same, I would do a programmming session.

For this to work I would need to setup a programming environment. The less distracting and complicated it is, the better. It should be easy to just start a new problem or contunue a previous one. I would also need to prepare a list of topics to learn or do during my traning. On other days I could plan and prioritize the topics. And last, but definitiely not least, writing about the learning. The writing will help in reflecting and thinking about the problem from different angles, reiterating on the solution, analysing each step.

Getting a little bit into the environment setup. Which machine I would like to setup, Dell with Linux or Mac? Would I prefer to have a command line environment or an IDE? Which programming language I should use? My main programming language is C++ and I definitiely would like to improve in it. On the other hand knowing different languages is also good, it broadens the perspective. 

For now I know that I want to ++(C++).
