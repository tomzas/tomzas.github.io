Well, yeah, the initial post will be short...

Welcome to Rub My Duck++, my programmer's journal and other things related to programming.

The name was inspired by 'rubber duckie' programming. The technique of solving a problem in which one takes a rubber duck and explains the stuff to it, literally by talking to it.

A blog sometimes serves the author to clear his head and reflect on what he is doing. It can be used as a 'rubber duck' to explain, reiterate, dump the clutter and sort it in order, so in the end the solution for a problem is cleaner and makes at least a little bit of sense.

On the other hand, publishing written content can help me improve in a two ways. First, it gives me a way to put myself out there, someone might read this. Second, publishing will help me improve my describing and presenting skills.

Let's see, I will give it a try...
