      <description>On Mac Docker for Desktop was the easy way to run development containers. With the license change, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer free for commercial use.
There is a good alternative:
Rancher Desktop.
Website: https://rancherdesktop.io/
By default Rancher Desktop is using the container runtime containerd, with which it recommends to use nerdctl. The nerdctl doesn&amp;rsquo;t support MacOS. The way Rancher makes it work is that it runs the nerdctl inside the VM that it spins up and command line tool is a wrapper script.</description>

      <title>Idea to name the posts</title>

      <description>How to name the files of the posts? I found a nice way to name the files of the posts for the blog.
This is not the title of the post, the title is a field in the Markdown file.
Initially I was using some sort of shortened title for the file name.
I came across the blog post Write Code Like You Just Learned How to Program.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think the post got to me, but I found the answer to my problem for the post file names.</description>
